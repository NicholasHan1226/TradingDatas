# TradingDatas public web candidate

Independent React/Vite candidate for the public `tradingdatas.com` product
experience. It does not replace the authenticated console under `frontend/`
or prove that the public domain, Pages route, DNS, HTTPS, commerce, account, or
API subdomain is live.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The prototype includes the confirmed public-home visual direction, responsive
Data/Features/Recipes/Research/Pricing/Docs navigation, a task-oriented Data catalog with
the connected-interface index, collection-history ledger, reviewed candidate-source landscape and phased integration roadmap, and
alternative-data ordering proposal, an external-paper/industry-research/case
library with internal detail records, transparent Feature definitions, versioned
Recipe examples, three proposed A-share workflow packages, a platform-wide
searchable Docs hub with article routes, independent history-aware product pages, a grouped Account workspace
containing `zh-CN`/`en` and system/light/dark settings, and a client-only Agent
setup prompt flow. `src/productManifest.js` is explicitly a design contract;
Feature/PIT/commerce states are not runtime claims. Example receipt values and the
`api.tradingdatas.com` address are explicitly proposal/synthetic UI content,
not runtime evidence.

The candidate landscape is maintained research, not an exhaustive list of every
global API. Technical reachability, redistribution rights, runtime activation,
receipt-backed availability and sellable package eligibility remain separate
states. See [`docs/product/DATA_SOURCE_LANDSCAPE.md`](../docs/product/DATA_SOURCE_LANDSCAPE.md).

Regenerate and verify the public contract/config snapshot after the provider
registry changes:

```bash
python scripts/build-connected-interface-snapshot.py
python scripts/build-connected-interface-snapshot.py --check
```

## Checks

```bash
npm run build
npm run test:sites
```

Keep the generated raster assets in `public/assets/`. Do not rebuild the brand
mark or data-material artwork with CSS, inline SVG, or placeholder elements.

## Production release

The public website is deployed to the existing Cloudflare static-assets Worker
named `tradingdatas`. `public-web/wrangler.jsonc` binds the committed
`dist/client` build to the small SPA fallback Worker in `dist/server/index.js`.
For direct navigation, that Worker serves the app shell for extensionless
`GET`/`HEAD` routes outside `/api/` and `/assets/`, even when a generic client
does not send `Accept: text/html`; the Worker fetches the root app shell
internally, so the requested deep-link URL is retained. Missing API routes,
assets, extensionful files, and non-navigation methods remain ordinary
fail-closed `404`s.

The Worker also contains the same-site Account session bridge under
`/api/account/*`. `ACCOUNT_API_BASE` is committed as the non-secret production
binding, while the deployment workflow writes `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the
GitHub repository secret of the same name using the explicit public Worker
configuration. If either is missing, authentication returns
`503 identity_gateway_unavailable`; there is no direct-bearer downgrade.
Same-origin sign-out still clears the cookie during an upstream/config outage.
The UI removes former `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` credentials, so legacy
direct sessions must sign in once again; server keys and grants are unchanged.
See `docs/API.md` and
`docs/OPERATIONS.md`; a code deploy alone is not evidence that the secure session
path is active.

`/login` shares the existing Account workspace and brand. Access-key login uses
only the encrypted same-site bridge; Phone and Email explicitly remain unavailable
until verified identity and message delivery are connected. They neither collect
contact details nor simulate sending a code. Identity and usage availability are
separate: a usage failure must not sign out an otherwise authenticated account.
Requests have timeouts; session changes invalidate late reads/key-write UI results.

Local synthetic UI verification: `npm run build`, then
`node scripts/login-qa-server.mjs` and open `http://127.0.0.1:5193/__qa`.
The harness binds only loopback, is single-reviewer, never calls upstream, and
accepts only synthetic test strings for review. It is not a production login test.

Pushes to `main` that change `public-web/**` run the repository Cloudflare
workflow. The workflow checks out the immutable source SHA, deploys the Worker,
then requires `/`, `/account/`, `/data/`, `/research/`, and `/pricing/` to return
HTTP `200`, retain the requested effective URL, and contain the exact JavaScript
asset referenced by that checkout. A local build or a successful upload alone is
not production evidence.
